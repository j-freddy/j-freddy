# ðŸŒŽ &nbsp; Hello, World!

I am passionate about all things AI and data science. I love to write code as I
consider it a form of art. I also love learning, building and automating things
with new tools and technologies.

I advocate for a transparent internet with guarantee of complete anonymity and 
privacy.

I like to philosophise about the future of human-robot interaction and the
extent to which foundational physical tasks, such as building houses and fixing
roads, can be automated by multi-agent systems equipped with edge AI. To that
end, I believe AGI is a good thing for humanity.

## ðŸ“š &nbsp; About me

I am a software engineer. I graduated from Imperial College London with an
master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and a bachelor's degree in Joint
Maths and Computer Science.

Outside of the digital world, I am active in the chess and table tennis scene 
at the county & district level.
